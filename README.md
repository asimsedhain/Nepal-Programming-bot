# ![Nepal Programming Bot](assets/nepal_programming_banner.png)

This repo holds the sources code for Discord bot that is currently being used in the Nepal Programming Discord server.

## Motivation
Nepal Programming Bot (formerly called the pomodoro bot) was initially made to track pomodoro count in the Nepal Programming Discord server.
From there, this project is spanning to allow more people to add their features while trying to teach basics of open source collaboration.

## Current Features

### `!pomo`
This is the initial and currently the only command supported by the bot. It allows the user to add their pomodoro count for the day with the command `!pomo COUNT`. At midnight Nepali time, the bot posts the results for the day.
